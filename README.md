# My Big Data Platform, a Proof of Concept

This repository provides a design for a big data platform used for network data processing.

It is the result of my programming assignments done for the course Big Data Platforms, 
which I followed at Aalto University during the Spring of 2021.

## What I used for this project
Python
- to write most of the code
- libraries like pandas, 

The project includes Python, Docker, Apache Cassandra, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka
